# Architecture

1. Data on positions for each treasury is retrieved from the data warehouse, using cronjobs that adjust the information to show it in the app.
    1. ETL - We have our own ETL fetching data related to positions
    DWH: Data on positions for each treasury (protocols, blockchains, tokens, volume).
    2. Cronjob runs scripts to modify information in the DWH to fill this data into json files

2. Thereâ€™s a list of preset exit strategies for each position using Roles Royce in a json file

3. Front end shows active positions, available exit strategies in the json, and tx info in the PBA UI

4. Tests
    1. All exit strategies in the json file for all positions in the DWH are tested through the stress tests in Roles Royce https://github.com/karpatkey/roles_royce/blob/main/tests/applications/panic_button_app/test_stresstest.py
