#Roadmap perspective

This app enables the manual execution of predesigned strategies (batch of tx carefully designed and tailored to our AM needs).
However, some of those predesigned strategies are to be automatically executed given specific triggers.
For example, an exploit suspected or a collateral ratio rapidly decreasing.
This strategies menu is also part of our *guardians modules* under development.
Guardians are bots that will automatically execute strategies.

Today, the app enables only positions exits in order to avoid potential losses, but it will broaden its scope towards enabling yield-chasing opportunities.
